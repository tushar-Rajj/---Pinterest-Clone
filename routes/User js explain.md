 **Project: Data Association**

**Overview:**
This project demonstrates how to create a user authentication system using MongoDB and Passport.js. It includes a User model with fields for username, password, posts, profile picture, email, and full name. The project uses the passport-local-mongoose plugin to simplify the authentication process.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install mongoose passport passport-local-mongoose
   ```

2. **Connect to MongoDB:**
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/DataAssociation");
   ```
   - This code establishes a connection to a MongoDB database named "DataAssociation" running on the local machine (localhost) at port 27017.

3. **Define the User Schema:**
   ```javascript
   const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     username: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
       unique: true,
     },
     password: {
       type: String
     },
     posts: [{
       type:mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
       ref:'Post'
     }],
     dp: {
       type: String
     },
     email: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
       unique: true,
     },
     fullname: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
     },
   });
   ```
   - This code defines the schema for the User model. It includes fields for username, password, posts, profile picture (dp), email, and full name (fullname).
   - The `username`, `email`, and `fullname` fields are required and must be unique.
   - The `posts` field is an array of references to Post objects.

4. **Use the passport-local-mongoose Plugin:**
   ```javascript
   userSchema.plugin(plm);
   ```
   - This code uses the passport-local-mongoose plugin to simplify the authentication process. It adds methods to the User schema for creating, authenticating, and salting passwords.

5. **Create the User Model:**
   ```javascript
